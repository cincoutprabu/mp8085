Evolution of MicroProcessor:
----------------------------

     History shows us that the ancient Babylonians first
began using the abacus (a primitive calculator made of
beads) in about 500 B.C.  This simple calculating machine
eventually sparked humanmind into the development of
calculating machinery that uses gears and wheels (Blaise
Pascal in 1642).  Refinements continued with the giant
computing machines of the 1940s and 1950s constructed
with relays and vacuum tubes.  Next the transistor and
solid-state electronics were used to build the mighty
computers in the 1960s.  Finally, the advent of the
Integrated Circuits (ICs) lead to the development of the
microprocessors and microprocessor - based computer
system.

     In 1971, Intel Corporation released the world's
first microprocessor - the INTEL 4004, a 4-bit
microprocessor.  It addesses 4096 memory locations of
word size 4-bit.  The instructions set consist of 45
different instructions.  The INTEL 4004 was soon followed
by a variety of microprocessors, with most of the major
semiconductor manufacturers producing one or more types.

     A variety of microprocessors were produced using
PMOS, NMOS and HMOS technologies.  The chip size, no. of
pins, no. of on-chip decoded timing signals, ability to
address large memory spaces, ability to address more
I/O ports, faster operation, more powerful instruction
set, no. of levels of subroutine nesting and better
interrupt handling capabilities keeps on increasing on
each of the new microprocessor.  Various companies like
Intel, Motorola, Zilog, etc. started introducing various
new types of microprocessors.  Circuit densities and
speed power product of each new microprocessor gets
increased with time.

     Some of the general applications of the
microprocessors are: calculators, game machines,
accounting systems, intelligent instrumentation, home
appliances, low and special purpose applications,
complex industrial controllers, instrumentation,
communications preprocessors, intelligent terminals,
process control systems, militiary applications, data
acquisition systems, business and data processing
applications, sophiscated real time control, advanced
communications, distributed processing networks, general
purpose computing applications requiring mainframe,
multi-user, multi-function environments, office
information equipment, etc.  Almost in every field of
science, Microprocessors has shown their power.


What is 8085 ?
--------------
     INTEL 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor.  It was
introduced by Intel Company, in mid 1970s.  It operates
on 8-bit data and uses 16-bit address.  Since it uses
16-bit address, it can directly address 2^16 = 65536 = 64K
memory locations.  The 8085 is designed using NMOS
transistors in 40 pin DIP (Dual In-line Package).  It
requires a single power supply of +5 volts.  The 8085
generates a clock signal internally and divide by two for
internal operations.

     The NMOS 8085 is available in two versions 8085A and
8085A-2 with maximum internal clock frequency of 3.03 MHz
respectively.  The enhanced version of 8085 is designed
with HMOS transistors.  It is available in three versions
8085AH, 8085AH-2 and 8085AH-1 with maximum internal clock
freqency of 3 MHz, 5 MHz and 6 MHz respectively.

  -----------------------------------------------------

     The low-order address byte and data lines AD0-AD7
are multiplexed.  At the beginning of a machine cycle
the address is given out AD0 to AD7 and it is latched
into external latch by using ALE.  Then the lines AD0
-AD7 are used to carry data.  The pins A8-A15 are
unidirectional and contain the high byte of the address.

     The RD^ signal is asserted low by the 8085 during a
memory or I/O read operation.  Similarly, the WR^ pin
signal is asserted low during a memory or I/O write
operation.

     The IO/M^, S0 and S1 are output by the 8085 during
its internal operations, which can be interpreted as in
the following table.

     The READY input can be used by the slower external
devices for obtaining extra time in order to communicate
with the 8085.  The READY is made low to provide wait
state clock periods in the machine cycles.

     The HOLD and HLDA signals are used for the Direct
Memory Access (DMA) type of data transfer.  The DMA
controller place a HIGH on HOLD pin in order to take
control of the system bus.  The HOLD function is
acknowledged by the 8085 by placing a HIGH output on the
HLDA pin.

     The 8085 has five interrupt pins.  The order of
priority of the interrupts is TRAP, RST 7.5, RST 6.5,
RST 5.5 and INTR.  The interrupts TRAP, RST 7.5, RST 6.5,
RST 5.5 are hardware vectored interrupt and are enabled
by appropriate signals at the appropriate pins of 8085.
When a vectored interrupt is enabled and if it is
accepted then the program execution branches to vector
addresses specified by Intel.  The interrupts RST 7.5,
RST 6.5 and RST 5.5 are maskable interrupts by software.

     The INTR is enabled by appropriate signal at its
pin.  In order to service INTR one of the eight opcodes
(RST 0 to RST 7) has to be provided on the 8085, AD0-AD7
bus by external logic.  The 8085 then executes this
instruction and vectors to the appropriate address to
service the interrupts.  The vector address for an
interrupt RST n is given by (08xn)H (TRAP is RST 4.5).
The vector addresses are listed in the following table.

   -----------------------   -----------------------
    Intrpt.  Vector Addr.     �Intrpt.� Vector Addr.
   -----------------------   -----------------------
     RST 0      0000H         � RST 5      0028H
     RST 1      0008H         � RST5.5     0020H
     RST 2      0010H         � RST 6      0030H
     RST 3      0018H         � RST6.5     0034H
     RST 4      0020H         � RST 7      0038H
     TRAP       0024H         � RST7.5     003CH
   ------------------------   ------------------------ 

     The 8085 has the clock generation circuit on the
chip but an external quartz crystal or LC circuit or
RC circuit should be connected at the pins X1 and X2.
The frequency at X1 and X2 is divided by 2 internally
for internal clock.  The frequency of output clock
signal is same as that of internal clock.

     The RESET IN^ signal, when pulsed LOW, causes the
8085 to execute the first instruction at the 0000H
location.  In addition, the 8085 resets instruction
register, interrupt mask bits and other registers.  The
RESET IN^ must be held LOW for at least three clock
periods.


Instruction execution and data flow in 8085:
--------------------------------------------

     The program instructions are stored in memory which
is an external device.  To execute the program in 8085,
the starting address should be loaded in program counter.
The 8085 the content of program counter in address bus
and asserts read control signal low.  Also, the program
counter is incremented.

     The address and the read control signal enables the
memory to output the content of memory location on the
data bus.  Now, the content of data bus is the opcode of
an instruction.  The read control signal is made high by
timing and control unit after a specific time.  At the
rising edge of read control signals the opcode is latched
into microprocessor internal bus and placed in
instruction register.

     The instruction decoding unit, decodes the
instructions and provides information to timing and
control unit to take further actions.


Origin of Software:
-------------------

     The software is a set of instructions or commands
needed for performing a specific task by a programmable
device.  The instructions needed for a programmable
device should be written using the symbols 0s and 1s.
The software development using 1s and 0s are called
machine language programs.  The machine level programs
are the first programs developed for programmable
devices and machines.  The machine can understand only
machine level programs.  But it is highly tedious for
a programmer to write program in machine language.

     Assembly level programs have been developed to
simplify the programming task.  The assembly level
programs are written using mnemonics.  The mnemonics
are given by the manufacturers of the microprocessors.
The assembly language programs are converted into
machine language programs by a conversion software
called Assembler.  Both the machine language and
assembly language programs are machine dependent.


Instruction Set:
----------------

     The 8085 has 74 basic instructions and 246
total instructions.  The instruction set of 8085 is
defined by the manufacturer Intel Corporation.  Each
instruction has one-byte opcode.  With 8-bit binary
code, we can generate 256 different binary codes.  In
these, 246 codes have been used for opcodes.

     The size of 8085 instruction can be 1,2 or 3 bytes.
The 1-byte instruction has an opcode alone and the
2-bytes instruction has an opcode followed by an eight
bit address or data.  The 3-bytes instruction has an
opcode followed by 16-bit address or data.  While storing
the 3-bytes instruction in memory, the sequence of
storage is, opcode first followed by low byte of address
or data and then high byte of address or data.

     The 8085 instruction set is divided into the
following five functional classifications:

               *  Data Transfer Instructions
               *  Arithmetic Instructions
               *  Logical Instructions
               *  Branching Instructions
               *  Machine Control Instructions
     

Data Transfer Instructions:
---------------------------

     These instructions includes those which or
copies data between registers or between memory
locations and registers.  In all data transfer operations
the content of source register is not altered.  Hence
the data transfer is copying operation.


Arithmetic Instructions:
------------------------

     These instructions includes those which performs
the addition, subtraction, increment or decrement
operations.  The flag condicitions are altered after
execution of an instruction by this group.


Logical Instructions:
---------------------

     Instructions which performs the logical operations
like AND, OR, EXCLUSIVE OR, complement, compare and
rotate instructions are grouped under this heading.  The
flag conditions are altered after execution of an
instruction in this group.


Branching Instructions:
-----------------------

     The instructions that are used to transfer the
program control from one memory location to another
memory location are grouped under this heading.


Machine Control Instructions:
-----------------------------

     This includes the instructions related to interrupts
and the instruction used to halt program execution.
