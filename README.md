# mp8085

8085 Microprocessor Instruction Set Compiler &amp; Simulator with graphical IDE, created for legacy MS-DOS environment using Turbo C++ 3.0. Developed it as a pet project during my bachelor's degree in the year 2003; it was soon popular across the college and was used by students to learn 8085 programming for Microprocessor coursework and lab sessions.

Users can enter 8085 microprocessor assembly instructions (opcodes), compile and run the program. Includes options to enter custom input values during runtime. Source code is provided as is from my backup archive from the year 2003.
